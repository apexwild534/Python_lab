**Practical 1: String Manipulation and Input/Output**

Objective: Understand string types, input/output, and basic string manipulations.

- Create a program that prompts the user to enter their name.
- Using the entered name, print a greeting message with the name in both uppercase and lowercase.
- Calculate and display the length of the entered name.
- Ask the user to enter a sentence and display it.

**Practical 2: Conditional Statements and Loops**

Objective: Explore conditional statements (if/elif), loops, and string operations.

- Request a numeric input from the user and check if it's even or odd.
- Create a loop that generates a list of numbers from 1 to the entered number, displaying only the even ones.
- Ask the user to enter a string and check if it contains the word 'Python'.
- Using the same string, display the string reversed.
- Create a program that generates a multiplication table from 1 to 10 for the entered number.





**Practical 3: Python File Handling Lab**

- **Objective: Learn and** practice **file handling operations in Python.**

**Task 1: Create and Write File**

Create a Python script to create a new text file and write user-input text into it.

Ensure each line of input is written as a new line in the file.

**Task 2: Read File Contents**

Develop a script to read the contents of the created file and display the content to the user.

Handle the case where the file is not found.

**Task 3: Append to the File**

Implement a program to append additional text to the existing file or create a new file if the file does not exist.

Prompt the user to input text and append it to the existing file content.

**Task 4: Count Lines in File**

Create a Python program to count and display the number of lines in the file.

Handle the scenario where the file is not found.

**Task 5: Copy File Content**

Write a script to copy the content of an existing file to a new file.

Verify the copied file content matches the original file content.

**Binary and CSV File Handling**

**Binary File Handling:**

**Task 1: Write to Binary File**

Create a program to write binary data to a file.

Prompt the user to input binary data, and store it in a binary file.

**Task 2: Read from Binary File**

Develop a Python script to read binary data from a file and display the content.

Ensure the retrieved binary data is displayed accurately.

**Task 3: Copy Binary File**

Write a script to copy the content of a binary file to another file.

Verify the copied file content matches the original binary file content.

**Task 4: Append to Binary File**

Implement a program to append additional binary data to an existing binary file.

Prompt the user to input binary data and append it to the existing file content.

**Task 5: Search and Replace Binary Data**

Create a Python program to search for specific binary data in a file and replace it with new binary data.

Display the content of the file after the search and replace operation.

**CSV File Handling:**

**Task 6: Read and Display CSV Content**

Develop a Python script to read a CSV file and display its content.

Format and print the contents in a readable manner.

**Task 7: Write to CSV File**

Create a program that takes user input and writes it to a CSV file.

The user input could represent a row in the CSV file.

**Task 8: Append to CSV File**

Implement a program to append additional data as a new row to an existing CSV file.

Prompt the user to input new data and append it to the existing CSV file.

**Task 9: Search and Modify CSV Content**

Write a Python script to search for specific data in a CSV file and modify it.

Display the CSV content after the modification.

**Task 10: Calculate Statistics from CSV Data**

Create a program to read a CSV file and calculate statistics, such as average, sum, or maximum values for numerical data present in the file.

**Practical 4: Error Handling and Exceptions**

Objective: Learn to handle syntax errors and exceptions using try/except blocks.

- Create a program with a syntax error and demonstrate how Python handles it.
- Write a function that takes two arguments and handles the ZeroDivisionError.
- Demonstrate the IndexError by attempting to access an index not present in a list.
- Ask the user to enter a number and handle the ValueError if a non-numeric value is entered.
- Use a try/except block to open a non-existing file and handle the FileNotFoundError.

**Practical 5: String Manipulation and Advanced List Operations**

Objective: Enhance string manipulations and apply advanced list operations.

- Ask the user to input a string and replace all vowels with a specific character (e.g., 'X').
- Create a list of numbers and display only unique elements without duplicates.
- Merge two lists and remove duplicates.
- Sort a list of strings in alphabetical order and display it.
- Combine the elements of two lists using list comprehension and display the result


**Lab Practical Questions on Pandas and NumPy**

Pandas:

**Task 1: Read and Display Data**

Load a CSV file using Pandas and display the first few rows of the data.

Describe the dataset by showing the column names, data types, and summary statistics.

**Task 2: Data Filtering and Selection**

Using Pandas, filter the dataset to display only specific columns or rows that meet certain conditions (e.g., values above a certain threshold).

Demonstrate the selection of specific columns or rows based on criteria.

**Task 3: Data Aggregation and Grouping**

Group the data by a specific column and calculate aggregate statistics (e.g., mean, sum, count) for each group.

Showcase the aggregated results after grouping.

**Task 4: Data Cleaning and Manipulation**

Identify missing values in the dataset and handle them (e.g., fill with mean, median, or drop rows/columns).

Show the dataset before and after the cleaning process.

**Task 5: Merging and Joining DataFrames**

Load and merge multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame using Pandas.

Display the merged DataFrame and perform operations like inner, outer, left, and right joins.

**NumPy:**

**Task 1: Array Creation and Manipulation**

Create a NumPy array filled with random numbers and display it.

Perform array manipulations like reshaping, slicing, and indexing.

**Task 2: Array Arithmetic and Aggregation**

Perform arithmetic operations on NumPy arrays (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) and display the result.

Calculate statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.

**Task 3: Conditional Array Operations**

Implement conditional operations on NumPy arrays (e.g., filtering arrays based on certain conditions).

Display the arrays before and after applying conditional operations.
